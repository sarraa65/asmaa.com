                <h2>what is recyling?</h1>
                    <p>It is the collection of used materials, then converting them into raw materials, and then
                        reproducing them to
                        become consumable materials again, and the concept of recycling can include anything old that
                        can be used
                        again,in other words, it is a process through which invalid materials are taken advantage of.
                        Which is
                        considered waste and introduced into new production and manufacturing processes</p>

                <h2>what is reshaping?</h1>
                    <p> we will explain the definition of sculpting and shaping scrap is the use of tools and pieces of
                        scrap metal
                        and employing them according to the need for each piece in sculpting the statue or in making a
                        piece of art
                        and sticking the pieces next to each other by oxygen welding or copper welding, and the concept
                        of building
                        artwork differs from the concept of cutting and pasting should We respect the standards of

                <h2>The difference between recycling and re usage</h1>
                    <p>Reuse is the process of taking old things you might be thinking of getting rid of and finding a
                        new use for
                        them.
                        Shape: does not change the original shape of the product <br> Recycling is the process of
                        collecting and
                        processing materials that would otherwise be disposed of as garbage and converting them into new
                        products
                        where recycling can benefit society and the environment.
                        Shape: A new product is created so the look of the product is changed</p>
